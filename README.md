# Team SQL Database App

This was Team-5's original attempt at making the Java Database program in STS. We ran into several problems and were unfamiliar
with STS as a whole. After being unable to fix some of our issues, we decided to forget about this program and restart from scratch.
However, since this repository had a somewhat decent commit history, we wanted to leave it on our organization page for use in our
final evaluation.

NOTE: This program is no longer being used or updated and does not run properly.
